    "Welcome to the final and most exciting exercise of the labcamp! ðŸš€ This is your chance to unleash your creativity and design a completely custom AI agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge:\n",
    "Your task is to create a unique AI agent using **LangGraph** that can solve a problem or perform tasks of your choice. You can define your own tools or use tools provided by LangChain (you can find the full list of available tools [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/)) to empower your agent with new capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideas for Tools:\n",
    "Here are some ideas for tools and tasks your agent could handle:\n",
    "1. **Web Browsing**: Use web-based tools to find information online in real time (e.g., fetch the latest news or stock prices).\n",
    "2. **Code Execution**: Execute Python code in a sandboxed environment and return the output, enabling your agent to solve programming-related queries.\n",
    "3. **API Integration**: Connect to external APIs for live data, such as weather updates, movie recommendations, or flight tracking.\n",
    "4. **Task Automation**: Use your agent to perform specific workflows, such as managing schedules, generating reports, or automating calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Youâ€™ll Learn:\n",
    "- **Advanced Tool Creation**: Build tools beyond simple functions to interact with external resources, including APIs, web scraping modules, or external databases.\n",
    "- **Real-World Applications**: Experiment with agents that resemble real-life use cases, building solutions for both functionality and fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines:\n",
    "1. **Define a Purpose**: Start by choosing what your agent will do. What problem will it solve or task will it perform?\n",
    "2. **Select Tools**: Use LangGraph-provided tools (e.g., web access, Python execution), create your own custom tools, or mix both.\n",
    "3. **Craft a System Prompt**: Write a clear system prompt defining your agentâ€™s role, purpose, and constraints.\n",
    "4. **Build the Agent**: Use `create_react_agent` to assemble and test your agent.\n",
    "5. **Iterate and Refine**: Test queries, adjust the system prompt and tool behavior, and debug to optimize your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ready to Begin?\n",
    "The possibilities are endlessâ€”your creativity is the limit! Now, letâ€™s dive in and start building your custom AI agent. "

    "### Iterative Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your agent is up and running, itâ€™s time to test it with your own queries! This hands-on testing allows you to evaluate:\n",
    "1. **How well the agent responds to expected queries** (e.g., asking the time in different locations).\n",
    "2. **Whether it handles unexpected or ambiguous queries gracefully** (e.g., if no location is provided or irrelevant questions are asked).\n",
    "3. **How effectively it uses the tools** to fulfill its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting the perfect agent is an **iterative process**. Use these trials to identify areas of improvement and adjust the agent as needed. Consider modifying the following aspects:\n",
    "- **System Prompt**: Adjust the wording to clarify the agentâ€™s purpose, add reasoning steps, or inject personality.\n",
    "- **Tool Definition**: Rename tools, change their parameters, or improve their descriptions for clarity and better integration.\n",
    "- **Model Settings**: Experiment with model temperature to balance determinism (`temperature=0`) and creativity (higher values).\n",
    "- **Tool Limitations**: For example, add error handling if an invalid timezone is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Effective Refinement:\n",
    "- If your agent isnâ€™t responding as expected, start by reviewing the reasoning trace.\n",
    "- Test with a wider variety of queries to account for edge cases.\n",
    "- Iterate gradually, making small adjustments to prompts, tools, or configurations one step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, building an AI agent is like sculptingâ€”it evolves over time with refinement and experimentation."
